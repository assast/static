    Download a few MB from time to time on a stopped or suspended file. (a file not completed is not taken into account as an activity)<br>
    <br>
    An upload refused (an unvalidated upload is not counted as an activity)<br>
    <br>
    Intervene on the shout. (the shout does not keep track of activities on the account or any history)<br>
    <br>
    Offer invitations. (it would be encouraging to distribute the invitations to anyone, not to mention that the members only have 2 except for the supporting members of the site who receive more)<br>
    <br>
    Send a PM (not a sufficient activity)<br>
    <br>
    Surfing the site (not sufficient activity)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>=&gt; <span style="color:#daa520">What is considered sufficient activity by the system for account survival:</span></h4><br>
    <br>
    Complete download of a torrent followed by a minimum of seeding for 72 hours (seeding less than 72 hours is not counted by the system as indicated in the ratio rule)<br>
    <br>
    an upload validated by the staff followed by a minimum seed of 72 hours (same reason as above)<br>
    <br>
    creation of posts on the forum (simple answers not being sufficient answer yes no ok hello welcome ....... does not constitute sufficient activity for the site).<br>
    <br>
    Torrent sharing coupled with a regular connection to the site is sufficient (regular in this case means at least once a month), long-term members sharing on the site are just as important as uploading to a tk.< br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We cannot adapt a rule to particular cases (travel around the world), nowadays even in the depths of the world we manage to have a small connection sufficient for a brief connection to the site (the opportunity may be to share on the forum the experience of the current trip).<br>
    <br>
    We are a private tracker and as the majority of members know, being registered on such a site is a privilege and not an acquired right, so you must earn the survival of your account by a minimum of activity.<br>
    <br>
    It is not mentioned on the support page but the supporting members of the site have inactivity immunity (originally on gazelle)<br>

                What is a Freeleech token for?<br>
                <br>
                A Freeleech token allows you to download a torrent without its ratio being affected.<br>
                On the other hand, if we leave the torrent shared, the seed is counted.<br>
                So it's all good and you absolutely have to use them to build a good ratio!<br>
                <br>
                How many tokens do I have?<br>
                <br>
                The number of tokens remaining is indicated in the bar at the top, next to the required ratio.<br>
                It is also indicated in the member page in the "statistics" section.<br>
                <br>
                How to use a Freeleech token?<br>
                <br>
                - Go to the page of the torrent you want to download.<br>
                - Then, to download the .torrent file, do not use the T button as usual, but the FL button.<br>
                - The site asks for confirmation, click on OK.<br>
                <br>
                Freeleech Token Notes and Limitations:<br>
                <br>
                - A Freeleech token can only be used once. If the .torrent file is opened again to download the file, the ratio will be counted.<br>

                - A Freeleech token is personal and cannot be transferred or used by another account.<br>

                - A Freeleech token expires after 10 days, so do not save the .torrent file to download it later otherwise it will no longer be valid. You must start the download immediately.<br>

                - Be careful to check that the torrent on which you are using a token has seed, otherwise the file will never arrive and you will have lost a token.<br>
                <br>
                The staff won't get you out of ratio problems if you don't use your Tokens!<br>

                <br>
                Seed points are intended to help members new to the site:<br>
                - Encourage members to stay in seed on torrents with little sharing in order to avoid the premature death of torrents.<br>
                - Encourage members to respond positively to reseed requests.<br>
                And not to please the members' e-penis, that's why beyond 3 seeders the torrent no longer earns points.<br>
                <br>
                You receive points on torrents that have a maximum of 3 seeders Once this number is exceeded, the torrent no longer earns points<br>
                <br>
                Points per 24H depending on the format:<br>
                <br>
                - mHD: 1h = 0.8333 (20 points / 24h)<br>

            <ul>
                <li>In this example, AKV downloaded 25 GB. It is therefore in the 20-30 GB range. Its maximum required ratio is therefore 0.30 and its minimum required ratio is therefore 0.05.
                </li>
                <li>In this example, AKV has 90 torrents completed, and is currently seeded to 45 torrents.</li>
                <li>To calculate AKV's current required ratio, we take its maximum required ratio, which is 0.30, and multiply it by [1 - (<var>torrents uploaded</var> / <var>torrents completed</ var>)] (which is 0.50). Which give:
                    <samp>0.30 * [1 - (45 / 90)] = 0.15</samp>
                </li>
                <li>The resulting ratio is therefore 0.15, which is between the maximum ratio of 0.30 and the minimum ratio of 0.05. The minimum ratio of AKV is therefore 0.15.

        A well-defined group, the Elite and supporters of HD-F can create a group of collections from several collections, having had the prior agreement of the staff.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        There can only be one collection for the same theme on the site. Any duplicate collections will be deleted.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        The theme and genre of the collections must be clearly indicated.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        Please check first if a similar collection is not already present. If so, please contribute to it.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        Please give a correct title and a fairly detailed description explaining the contents of the collection.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        Please be careful to add a poster for each movie in your collection.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        Collections make it possible to group together torrents forming a coherent cinematographic whole. For example: the Star Wars saga, the James Bonds, the Hitchcock collection, etc.
                    </li>
        <br>
        <li>
        The collections do not need to be complete from the moment they are created: they can be added to progressively.

                The cropping of the black bands is not mandatory (but recommended in 720p format).<br>
                Any aspect ratio error greater than 0.5% will result in the withdrawal of the release.<br>
                The deblock is set to a minimum, it can go up to -3 for movies. For anime, the deblock value must be positive, given the relative flatness of animations, it can be zero. The minimum value would therefore be 0 to 2.<br>
                The video bitrate must in principle have a minimum value depending on the category of the encode (see below). Depending on the source used, it is sometimes useless to have such a high bitrate. This can then be lower than the minimum usually required, so as not to unnecessarily weigh down the MKV file. In this case, the post of the encode on the site must necessarily be accompanied by: - &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;a source/encode comparison of at least 3 screens (frameB images), - the qp part of the encoding log presenting the qpframe I, P and B (the qp frameB should not exceed 20). With these elements, the staff (helped by the encoders) will be able to determine if the encode corresponds to the desired quality on HD-F.<br>

                Deinterlacing should be used for interlaced sources.<br>
                The ivtc must be performed on the sources in 29.970 fps.<br>
                The cropping of the black bands is not mandatory (but recommended in 720p format).<br>
                Any aspect ratio error greater than 0.5% will result in the withdrawal of the release.<br>
                The deblock is set to a minimum, it can go up to -3 for movies. For anime, the deblock value must be positive, given the relative flatness of animations, it can be zero. The minimum value would therefore be 0 to 2.<br>
                The video bitrate must in principle have a minimum value depending on the category of the encode (see below). Depending on the source used, it is sometimes useless to have such a high bitrate. This can then be lower than the minimum usually required, so as not to unnecessarily weigh down the MKV file. In this case, the post of the encode on the site must necessarily be accompanied by: - &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;a source/encode comparison of at least 3 screens (frameB images), - the qp part of the encoding log presenting the qpframe I, P and B (the qp frameB should not exceed 20). With these elements, the staff (helped by the encoders) will be able to determine if the encode corresponds to the desired quality on HD-F.<br>

        <div class="box pad rule_summary" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 20px;">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Most forums (Tutorials, The Library, etc.) have their own rules. Be sure to read these rules before posting in any of these forums.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not use excessive capitals or !!! (exclamation marks) or the ??? (question marks). It sounds like you're screaming
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not ask for money for any reason..
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not display your uploads inappropriately.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not ask for concert or other films on the forums. There is a link at the top of the page to create a query.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No nervousness; be polite and courteous. Don't use offensive language, and don't get into a fight just for fun.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not attack other members on their sharing ratios. A better ratio does not make you better than another.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid asking stupid questions. A stupid question is one that you can answer yourself with minimal research, or that you ask in the wrong place.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be sure to read all topics before posting yours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use subject descriptions and specifications. This will help others spot particular words in popular topics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid posting comments that add nothing to the discussion.
                    <p>
                        Or in short: NO SPAM
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                     When quoting, use only the necessary portion of the quote!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not post requests for releases (apart from the Requests section). No links to warez or other sites in forums or torrent comments. It is also forbidden to name any download site (P2P, DDL, etc.) in comments on torrents or on the forum (except parts of the forum reserved for Elite+).
                </li>
                <li>
                    No religious or political discussion. This kind of discussion often irritates the members.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don't waste other members' bandwidth by posting images that are too big.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be patient with new members. Don't forget that you have been there once.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not ask for an invitation on the site or on the IRC. Invitations can only be <strong>offered</strong> in the invitation forum, and nowhere else.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No language other than French and English is authorized in the forums. What we don't understand, we can't monitor!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be careful when posting mature content in forums. All images depicting mature content should be governed by the <a href="wiki.php?action=article&amp;id=1063">rules found here</a>. Free or violent sexual content posted elsewhere than in the authorized place will be severely punished.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mature content should be properly tagged. The correct format is as follows: <strong>[mature=description] ...content... [/mature]</strong>, where "description" is a required description of the content of the post.

            <ol>
                <li>The staff has the last word. If a staff member says stop and you continue, you will most likely be banned from IRC.</li>
                
                <li>Be respectful of IRC operators and admins. These people are volunteers of the site. Don't waste their time.</li>
                    
                <li>Using too many profanities will result in a ban; swear a minimum.</li>
                
                <li>Don't leave the "caps lock" key enabled. It's pointless and you'll self-ban.</li>
                
                <li>Don't argue. You can't win against an internet argument, you'll just waste your time trying.</li>
                
                <li>No prejudice, especially regarding race, religion, politics, ethnicity, etc. It is highly recommended to avoid it.</li>
                
                <li>Spam is completely prohibited.</li>
                
                <li>Do not send PMs or questions to people you don't know or have never spoken to without asking first; this applies especially to the staff.</li>
                
                <li>Avoid "exotic" languages ​​other than French and English.</li>
                
                <li>Offering, selling, trading, and gifting invites to here or any other site on our IRC is <strong>totally prohibited</strong>.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>We recommend the scene standard for the tag, although it is not mandatory</li>
                <li>Untag/retag: do not untag/retag (rename) the file of a release taken elsewhere repost it here without modification.</li>
                <br>
                It is very important to respect the TAG of a release, (This is the name given to it by the encoder.)<br>
                <br>
                <div style="color:green;">Conforming example:</div><br>
                <li>BR FULL => The.Box.2009.1080p.Blu-ray.AVC.DTS-HD.MA.5.1-HDForever</li>
                <li>Remux =&gt; The.Box.2009.MULTi.1080p.BluRay.REMUX.AVC.DTS.HDMA.5.1-HDForever</li>
                <li>BluRay Rip &amp; mHD =&gt;The.Box.2009.MULTi.VFF.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS.HDMA.5.1-HDForever</li>
                <br>
                Sometimes you have untagged files that you would like to share:<br>
                - Or because you yourself renamed it for your film library<br>
                - Either because you found it on a site that doesn't respect tags.<br>
                <br>
                <div style="color:red;">Invalid example:</div><br>
                The.Box.2009<br>
                The.Box.2009.iso<br>
                The.Box.2009.mkv<br>
                <br>
                So you need to find the original name.<br>
                It is possible to search on trackers and warez sites to find the release.<br>
                You can also try google with file size and name.<br>
                <li>Or seek help from HD-F members <a href="https://hdf.world/forums.php?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=367" target="_blank">[Help] Finding the TAG of a release</a></li>
