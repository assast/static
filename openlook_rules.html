o You can register the material as a prohibited release only if you personally purchase, encode, produce, or participate in the material.<br>
- Applicable if you extracted the FLAC file and the EAC/XLD log file that recorded the unique extraction process together from the CD.<br>
- Loss sound sources downsampled from the above data can also be designated as exclusive materials without rating restrictions if the first uploader wishes.<br>
- The right to downsample from the above data can also be specified if the first uploader wishes.<br>
- If you have an exclusive setting of downsampled lossy sound sources and do not want other users to downsample, please use the Do not leak field.<br>
- The purpose of this is to protect rare materials, so please refrain from limiting the loss of sound sources that can be obtained from places such as Melon and Bugs.<br>
- WEB music purchased online by yourself can only be applied at the highest bitrate being serviced at that time.<br>
- If a higher bit rate sound source serviced by another company is uploaded as a material to be leaked later, the exclusive setting of the previous material will be lifted.<br>
ex) When Melon's highest bitrate (320kbps) sound source is uploaded with exclusive setting and then Bugs' highest bitrate (FLAC) sound source is uploaded with exclusive setting<br>
- In the case of a WEB sound source, a screenshot with download history must be attached to "Individual Torrent Information" to prove that you have purchased the sound source yourself.<br>
- When attaching a screenshot, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Must</span> use an overseas image hosting server. Recommended site: <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://anonym.to/?https://myimg.me"><strong>MyIMG</strong></a>, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://anonym.to/?http://imgur.com"><strong>imgur</strong></a>, <a rel=" noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://anonym.to/?http://www.imageshack.us"><strong>ImageShack</strong></a><br>
- The WEB chart sound source follows the chart sound source rules, and can be set exclusively if it is over 192kbps.<br>
- Regardless of whether or not the data to be leaked is set, if data in the same state is uploaded before, it is considered a duplicate.<br>
