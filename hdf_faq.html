        The software is signed by the designer of the protocol&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://www.clubic.com/telecharger-fiche11039-bittorrent.html">BitTorrent</a>&nbsp ;and software of the same name; first official software dedicated to the sharing network. His particuliarity ? Being lighter and easier to use.<br>
        Although<strong>µTorrent</strong>weighs only 1MB and has a relatively clean interface, that doesn't mean it lacks features.<br>
        Of course, it has the minimum functions required for such software: adding .torrent files, sharing, managing magnet links, managing files and priorities, but not only. This includes, for example, a configurable search engine.<br>
        <strong>µTorrent</strong>&nbsp;can also manage RSS feeds for you so you don't miss any of your download feeds.<br>
        The software can also be controlled remotely either by its smartphone application or via a web interface. Convenient to launch downloads on your computer as soon as you have the idea.<br>
        The installation process of&nbsp;<strong>µTorrent (uTorrent)</strong>&nbsp;includes an automatic download module for the&nbsp;<strong>French translation</strong>.<br>

        <div class="pad"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BITRATE:</strong></span><br>
        A measure of the amount of digital data transmitted per unit time.<br>
        It is most often expressed in bits per second (bps) and kilobits/s (kbps) per 1000 bps.<br>
        For a film, we speak of a total bitrate (ex: 9610 Kbps) as the sum of the video bitrate (example: 8000 Kbps) and the audio bitrate (ex: 1610 Kbps).<br>
        It is an indicator of the quality of a release (the higher the bitrate, the higher the quality expected of a release)<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BITTORRENT:</strong></span><br>
        The Bittorrent protocol is a process for exchanging "big" data between several people.<br>
        To put these people in contact you need what is called a tracker (site that centralizes the .torrent files necessary for exchanges) such as HD-F.<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        CUSTOMER:</strong></span><br>
        In a computer network a client is the principle that sends requests to a server. It can be software manipulated by a person, or a bot. The client can be a computer, software or computing device and as such depends on a server.<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        CODEC:</strong></span><br>
        Codec comes from compression-decompression or coding-decoding (COde-DECode in English). A codec is a process capable of compressing and/or decompressing a digital signal.<br>
        On the one hand, codecs encode streams or signals for data transmission, storage or encryption. On the other hand, they decode these streams or signals for editing or playback. For example, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 is a video standard, and x264 is a codec capable of producing a video stream adhering to this standard.<br>
        <br>
        Example of Audio Codecs allowed on HDF:<br>
        AC-3, DTS, TrueHD, DTS-HD, PCM, ATMOS, EAC3, FLAC<br>
        <br>
        Example of video Codecs allowed on HDF:<br>
        x264, x265, VC-1, AVC<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        CROP (CROPPING, CROPPER)</strong></span><br>
        Action of cutting the black bands at the top and bottom of the image at the time of encoding to reduce the size of the release without hindering the image. Cropping is optional and is not performed by all encoders. Mainly used by US scene and trackers.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DETAG:</strong></span><br>
        Action of deleting a signature, or Tag, usually found at the end of a torrent's name.<br>

        Download, download.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ENCODING:</strong></span><br>
        Transform the signal of a video (example: Full BluRay or Remux) to another format (ex: HDrip 1080p) to reduce the weight, reducing the quality to a minimum.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FAKE:</strong></span><br>
        In French, it means False or Imposture. This means, here, that the torrent offers content that has no relation to the presentation or does not exist. For example, a torrent offering Ccleaner 10.4 is a fake since this tool does not exist in this version.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FANSUB:</strong></span><br>
        Action of subtitling a video for personal and non-professional purposes. The quality of Fansubs can vary greatly (translation accuracy, mistakes, etc.) and these are called FastSubs.<br>

        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FREE LEECH:</strong></span><br>
        This principle only exists on trackers using a ratio system. It is based on the fact that the amount of data downloaded is not counted by the tracker and therefore the ratio cannot go down. The shares remain in the accounts so, in addition to being able to download without limit, your ratio can increase. Enjoy!<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FRENCH, FR:</strong></span><br>

        There are mainly three HD categories:<br>
        - 720p or HD Ready (1280x720 in 16:9)<br>

        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        PEER TO PEER, P2P:</strong></span><br>
        Peer-to-peer, often abbreviated “P2P” and peer-to-peer in French, is a computer network model close to the client-server model but where each client is also a server. Peer-to-peer systems allow multiple computers to communicate over a network, and most often, simply share files.<br>
        Peer-to-peer allowed a decentralization of systems, previously based on a few servers, by allowing all computers to play the role of client and server.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>POST, POSTER:</strong></span><br>

        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PREZ:</strong></span><br>
        Abbreviation for presentation. The prez is the visible part of your upload. This is the page that appears when viewing a torrent.<br>
        A Prez can be created by a prez generator (there are many) or by hand. A prez uses BBCODE tags and must follow upload rules.<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        PROPER:</strong></span><br>
        Is a tag that can be added in the name of a release if it has already been made by another team in a lower quality (use of another Telesync, or one from the same source, but of better quality ). This may also indicate a better translation for subtitles unlike FASTSUBs which are hasty translations.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PV:</strong></span><br>
        Abbreviation for "Private".<br>
        Often used to tell someone to communicate<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        RATIO:</strong></span><br>
        Total uploaded divided by total downloaded<br>
        See here rules.php?p=ratio<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        READ.NFO:</strong></span><br>

        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RELEASE:</strong></span><br>
        English word meaning "release" or "release" release of a film or a music album, ... Final product of a team.<br>
        <br>
        REMUX<br>
        Video and audio tracks from a BluRay are "multiplexed" into a .mkv container without undergoing re-encoding, which maintains the same quality as Blu-ray, while reducing weight by removing unnecessary languages , menus or bonuses<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REPACK:</strong></span><br>
        If a release is not good or something was missing and a correction is made that will solve the problem, it will be completely redone in Repack. It can also be a rip of a 700MB video from the 1.4GB version.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RE-TAG:</strong></span><br>
        The Retag consists of uploading a file with a file name that is not the original one, which does not facilitate its classification and correction.<br>
        Example Gladiateur.1080p.MULTi.kekeflo instead of Gladiateur.1080p.MULTi.TBB<br>
        It is forbidden on HD-F but it is true that members often download already re-tagged files elsewhere to upload them here.<br>
        It is possible to do a tag search on Google Title+Format+exact size.<br>
        See here forums.php?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=367<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RIP:</strong></span><br>
        This is to create a file containing for example a film recovered from the original source (dvd/bluray).<br>
        This file is usually much smaller in size, by a compression process, and requires the codec corresponding to the compression technique to play.<br>
        A BluRay rip will be the rip of a BluRay and depending on the codec used it may or may not be played on different devices.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCRAPE:</strong></span><br>
        The Bittorrent client starts with a scrape, which consists of asking the tracker for information on the total number of sources (seeds) and leeches (leech).<br>
        This number will usually be displayed in parentheses.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SEED, SEEDER:</strong></span><br>
        Leaving torrents active in your bittorrent client causes them to be seeded. You are therefore considered a "Seeder" on shared torrents.<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        SEEDBOX:</strong></span><br>
        A seedbox, in BitTorrent jargon, corresponds to a server (therefore equipment designed to operate 24 hours a day) which has a good internet connection on which a BitTorrent client is installed which will take care of "seeder", that is to say to share torrent files for you<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DEDICATED SERVER:</strong></span><br>
        Remote computer made available to a single client by a host and which can be managed remotely via the Internet network. It can host among other things a Seedbox, allowing to download and share torrents at a high speed and in a protected way.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SHOUTBOX:</strong></span><br>
        A shoutbox (Anglicism for "discussion box") is an instant messaging system, integrated into a Web page that allows people to leave messages on the site. It is also a very fast tool, considering that the box is already ready. All that remains is to type the message and click on the send button.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SOURCE:</strong></span><br>
        To be a seed and therefore to be a Seeder is to be a source. You are the source that will provide the content you share to whoever asks for it.<br>
        You are the original source, if you are sharing your own upload for the first time.<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        STV:</strong></span><br>
        Straight To Video, a film never released in cinemas and directly on sale.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HARDSUB:</strong></span><br>
        Subtitles embedded in the video that appear during passages in foreign languages. HARDSUBs are not encouraged as they cannot be removed or mined.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TAG:</strong></span><br>
        The TAG is the uploader's signature. It is placed at the end of the name of this one.<br>
        Ex: The.Smurfs.2.2013.MULTI.1080p.BluRay.x264-NERDHD &lt;- the TAG is NERDHD<br>
        It is important to respect the uploader's TAG otherwise it is a DETAG or a RETAG.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TEAM:</strong></span><br>
        Regarding the Bittorrent world, it is a group of people who make their own releases and upload them themselves under their banner. These groups mostly exist to commit to providing quality.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TRACKER:</strong></span><br>
        A BitTorrent tracker identifies downloaders in order to put them in contact with each other. People interested in the same content will form what is called a cluster (Swarm). The role of the tracker is then to communicate the coordinates of each user of the same cluster. This cluster is actually associated with the .torrent file, which also identifies the content.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TRUEFRENCH:</strong></span><br>

        Shared file. (Up,Upload)<br>
        Send data, upload, share, seed. (Upload)<br>
        Also use to talk about the person who is sharing (the uploader).<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        UPSCALE:</strong></span><br>
        It's taking a lower resolution video and converting it to a higher resolution video. This is prohibited on quality trackers.<br>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>
        VFF:</strong></span><br>
        French version. Also called TRUEFRENCH.<br>

        <br>
        <span style="color: #ff7700;"><font size="4">What's in a .torrent file?</font></span></strong><br>
        It contains information such as the IP address of the server (or domain name) of the tracker (here HD-F) (which will relay the sharing information to other peers), and a hash fingerprint, unique to each torrent. <br>
            <br>
        <span style="color: #ff7700;"><font size="4"><strong>How do I use my .torrent?</strong></font></span><br>
        To do this, you need a <a href="/wiki.php?action=article&amp;id=7">torrent client</a>, it is this client that will process the .torrent file and retrieve the content that is bound.<br>
            <br>
        <span style="color: #ff7700;"><font size="4"><strong>What is the tracker for?</strong></font></span><br>
        A tracker is a server that always knows which <span style="font-style: italic;">seeds</span> and which <span style="font-style: italic;">peers</span> are connected to torrent file. Customers regularly send him information.<br>
        In exchange, they receive information (ex: IP addresses) concerning the other clients to which they can connect. The tracker is not directly involved in the data transfer and does not own a copy of the file.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: #ff7700;"><font size="4"><strong><strong>Seeders</strong> / Leechers?</strong></font></span><br>
        The leecher is someone who is connected to the torrent but does not own the file, or not all of it.<br>
         The seeder is someone who is connected to the torrent AND owns the whole file.<br>
            <br>
        <span style="color: #ff7700;"><font size="4"><strong>Upload / Download?</strong></font></span><br>
        Upload is the amount of data you have sent. The download is the amount of data you <br>
        downloaded.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: #ff7700;"><font size="4"><strong>The ratio</strong></font></span><br>
        The ratio is calculated this way: Ratio = Upload / Download<br>
        As a member of HD-F, you have an "overall" ratio of your account (present at the top left). It is also indicated the minimum ratio required on the site. You can find more info on <a href="/rules.php?p=ratio">ratio here.</a><br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Your post violated one or more of the forum rules.<br>
        <br>
        <blockquote>Forum Rules<br>
        Most forums (Tutorials, The Library, etc.) have their own rules. Be sure to read these rules before posting in any of these forums.<br>
        <br>
        Do not use excessive capitals or !!! (exclamation marks) or the ??? (question marks). It sounds like you're screaming<br>
        Do not ask for money for any reason..<br>
        <br>
        Do not display your uploads inappropriately.<br>
        <br>
        Do not ask for concert or other films on the forums. There is a link at the top of the page to create a query.<br>
        <br>
        No nervousness; be polite and courteous. Don't use offensive language, and don't get into conflict just for fun.<br>
        <br>
        Do not attack other members on their sharing ratios. One better ratio doesn't make you better than another.<br>
        <br>
        Avoid asking stupid questions. A stupid question is one that you can answer yourself with minimal research, or that you ask in the wrong place.<br>
        <br>
        Be sure to read all topics before posting yours.<br>
        <br>
        Use subject descriptions and specifications. This will help others spot particular words in popular topics.<br>
        <br>
        Avoid posting comments that would add nothing to the current discussion: NO SPAM<br>
        <br>
        When quoting, use only the necessary portion of the quote!<br>
        <br>
        Do not post requests for releases (apart from the Requests section). No links to warez or other sites in forums or torrent comments. <br>
        <br>
        It is also forbidden to name any download site (P2P, DDL, ...) in commentary on torrents or on the forum (except parts of the forum reserved for Elite+).<br>
        <br>
        No religious or political discussion. This kind of discussion often irritates members.<br>
        <br>
        Don't waste other members' bandwidth by posting images that are too big.<br>
        <br>
        Be patient with new members. Don't forget you've been there once.<br>
        <br>
        Do not ask for an invitation on the site or on the IRC. Invitations can only be offered in the invitation forum, and nowhere else.<br>
        <br>
        No language other than French and English is authorized in the forums. What we don't understand, we can't monitor!<br>
        <br>
        Be careful when posting mature content in forums. All images depicting mature content should be governed by the rules found here. Free or violent sexual content posted elsewhere than in the authorized place will be severely punished.<br>
        <br>
        Mature content should be properly tagged. The correct format is as follows: <strong class="mature" style="font-size: 1.2em;">Mature content:</strong><strong> description</strong><br> <a href="javascript :void(0);" onclick="BBCode.spoiler(this);">View</a><blockquote class="hidden spoiler"> ...content... </blockquote>, where "description" is a required description of the content of the post .<br>

        is allowed under 2 conditions. <br>
        <br>
        1) The torrent has already been 100% shared by the uploader at least once. <br>
        2) The torrent was uploaded more than 72h (3 days) ago and still hasn't been shared.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Apart from that, cross seeding is encouraged for the oldest torrents present on the site in order to prevent torrents from losing all these seeders.<br>
        This practice allows members who do not upload to share on torrents already present on the site and to be entitled to seed points that they can exchange for GB of upload.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: #ff0000;">In case of cross seeding that does not respect these rules, it is up to the uploader to notify the staff.</span><br>
