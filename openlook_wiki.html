                    Degradation during the warning period will be charged at the same time, and will be adjusted automatically by the scheduler at the end of the warning period.

                    The duration of the warning depends on its severity. Intentional violations of the rules or continuous violations of the same rules act as aggravating factors. Also, if you break the rules again while already being warned, you may end up with an extended period or your account being banned.

            <div class="pad">It is inconvenient that the file list of torrent information is displayed in order of capacity, so we are often asked to change it. However, the torrent file list is not sorted by this site. It just prints them out in the order they are stored in the torrent seed. The problem is in the seed file itself, so be careful when creating it.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a problem caused by adding an option to torrent creation after utorrent v1.8.3.

                In the Create New Torrent window, an option called <strong>Preserve file order</strong> has been added as indicated by a box. This option is to select whether to sort by file name when generating torrent seeds. If this option is not selected, they will be sorted by capacity. It is unchecked by default, so you need to check it.

                <strong>Grouping function</strong> - In our tracker, a group is a function that puts related data together in one place.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since the original source of our trackers was developed for music trackers, the 'artist' and 'album title' become the key elements of the group. The biggest commonality between each group is the âartistâ, and within one group, the artistâs âalbum titleâ is common. Also within that group are small groups like "Format" and "Edition Type". This structure is illustrated as follows.

                Did you get the hang of it?
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                For those of you who don't know why you need that yet, here's an example.
                <br>
                Let's take a look at what it will look like when grouping is done properly.
                <br>
                <br>
                The target is TV, which is the category the grouping will be actively applied to.
                <br>
                Let's use the tragic drama '2009 Foreigners', which ended early.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                If you watch a few dramas come and go, and see the list printed, it'll be something like this.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align:center">

                You can see E02 and E03, and there are videos in various formats for each episode.

                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                Torrents of E02 and E03 are neatly gathered. It's a pity I don't have E01.
                <br>
                You can find them separately in the search, but what did you put them here for? Then why is music grouped by artist? If you do a search anyway, you will find all music related to the artist. The advantage of a group is that it is not just collected, but that the order is arranged naturally, so it is easy to know which sashimi is omitted or duplicated, and information about the target corresponding to the group can be viewed.
                <br>
                Instead, the information here has to be filled out by someone. Someone should link the program poster. It is not a part that you write when uploading a torrent, but you need to do some manual work separately. But it's not that difficult. There are 7 torrents up right now, and only one of the torrent uploaders needs to come forward and write it. Or anyone looking at this place can write it. Anyone can freely edit by going to 'Edit Artist' among the various menus at the top. It's kind of like a wiki. (*Everyone has the right to edit, and there is a difference in the scope of edits depending on the membership level.)
                <br>
                With care written by only one person, all relevant torrents in the program group can benefit from it. Those who want to touch instead of seeing materials that have only been uploaded torrents without any explanation or are written incorrectly in P will be able to solve the problem here.
                <br>
                If you look on the right side, there is a section called 'Similar Artist', where you can write the name of the related program and link it. For example, we can link other dramas in which Yoon Tae-young appeared. If you use it well, you can conveniently navigate through related programs with just a click. (*The 'Similar Artist' feature does not work properly yet)
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, since most of the group-related signs are based on music, they are coming out as 'artists' rather than 'programs'.
                <br>

                <br>
                If all the episodes were uploaded, they would be lined up in order, but if the hundreds of episodes are all scattered here, the scrolling would be too long. However, you can upload packs for one season or multiple episodes, so someone will upload them as packs. Sessions corresponding to that will be deleted. It would be nice to see the unfinished ones lined up by each episode and the finished ones arranged neatly by season, right?
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now that we're done browsing, let's dive into each episode. Press E03 the 3rd time to enter.

                <br>
                <br>
                It looks like only a part of the list has been ripped off, but it's nothing special.
                <br>
                However, if you look closely, there is information about the third episode, not the entire program. This is a drama with a continuous story, so it may not be of much use, but it will be useful as a guide for the cast in programs where guests change frequently like entertainment programs. This too can be modified by anyone if they wish. Go to the 'Edit Contents' menu at the top and edit it in the same way as 'Edit Artist'. (*Everyone has the right to edit, and there is a difference in the scope of edits depending on the membership level.)
                <br>
                <br>
                But I can't see any screenshots or video encoding information.
                <br>
                I was curious, so I clicked on one of the top lists.

                <br>
                Oh, it was hidden here. Why did you hide it so tightly?
                <br>
                That's just to make it easy to see multiple formats in one place.
                <br>
                You can easily compare each torrent by unfolding it without moving the page, closing it, and expanding the other one.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                It is necessary to distinguish the use of the area in Figure â¢ above and the area in Figure â£ above.
                <br>
                No. â¢ is a place to store common information of all torrents bound here like the plot of each episode, and No. â£ is where you have to enter your own information that is different for each torrent material. Screenshots will be different for each torrent. So, you have to enter the hidden area of ââNo. â£. If you put it in the area of ââNo. 3, it will be difficult for the person who uploads material of a different quality or release next time. They should only play on their own land.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is an important distinction, so let's see where these areas relate to when uploading torrents.

                <br>
                I'm explaining the group, so I can't help but follow that part.
                <br>
                If you look at the top of the picture, there is a part marked in green and a part marked in orange.
                <br>
                The part marked in green corresponds to the owner of the 'large group'. Here, the title of the program will be '2009 Foreign Team'.
                <br>
                The part marked in orange is probably a 'small group'. You must enter a 'broadcast round'.
                <br>
                These two parts have the same structure as the data of other categories to which the group is applied, so either category should be entered with special care.
                <br>
                <br>
                And if you look down, there is an area marked in blue and red.
                <br>
                <span style="color:blue">blue</span> is the area of âââ¢ mentioned above. Enter the general information for that round.
                <br>
                <span style="color:red">Red</span> is only applicable to uploading torrents, and is the area shown in figure â£ above.
                <br>
                It would be appropriate to include screenshots and encoding information.
                <br>
                <br>
                The two divisions are also applied in the same structure to other classifications, only the name is different. Just remember to put general information in the upper area and the information directly related to the torrent in the lower area, so you don't make the mistake of writing in the wrong place.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, if you have looked at this much, wouldn't it have been better to understand the group?
                <br>
                <br>
                The same goes for movie groups. The only difference is that 'director' is entered instead of 'program title' and 'movie title' is entered instead of 'running'. Everything else has the same structure. You have a large group of several movies from the same director, and clicking on each movie will create a smaller group of movies containing that movie's multiple formats.
                <br>
                Other classifications are omitted because the group is less important.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Using format addition</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                As mentioned above, in order to properly form a group, you must enter a name that exactly matches the part that binds the 'large group' and the 'small group'. If you enter the 'name' correctly, it will be automatically bound. But if it's even slightly different, the human eye knows that it's related, but the computer doesn't know it and throws it in the wrong place. In order to prevent duplication before registering any materials, you can also check whether there are related materials during the search process. And if it has already been uploaded, you can apply the name used for the material as it is. There is a function to help input even a little in such a case. It's called <strong>add format</strong>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Format addition is available only when certain materials have already been registered. Because it is on the information page of that material.

                It came out like an upload form to fill in when uploading, but if you look closely, something is different.
                <br>
                Pre-entered parts are sparse. If you look closely, the pre-entered information corresponds to the same information as previously uploaded torrents. Since the classification that uses the 'Add Format' function is a movie now, parts that can be recycled without re-entering such as director, movie title, and production year, especially those related to grouping, are entered in advance for convenience. As long as you enter the rest of the information correctly, you do not have to worry about whether it will be a group or not. Therefore, if you want to upload a file that is different only in the format of the file that has already been uploaded, you can actively use the 'Add Format' menu to upload data systematically and conveniently.
                <br>
                Also, in the case of area â¢, which contains general information that is not directly related to torrents, the contents entered later will overwrite the previous contents. It would be futile if someone wrote it well before and uploaded it, but someone who uploads it later writes it out roughly and overwrites it. The general information is kept as it is when 'add format' is done, so be sure to use 'add format' function when adding data with only a different format for that reason.
                <br>
                And don't forget that those of you who are the first to post related material are pioneers. Depending on how you upload it in the first place, you need to be especially careful when uploading as it can determine whether a good or bad upload will follow.

                <strong>Customize grouped output</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are not familiar with gazelle or like a style like P, the style in which the torrent list is output may be awkward. Most of them use the default settings as they are, so the things hanging around each group are different, so it won't catch your eye at first. Just because grouping is done, it is not necessary to apply and output the search contents unconditionally. There are three output methods, so you can choose the one you like.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you go to the '<strong>Profile</strong>' menu next to the ID, there is a '<strong>Torrent grouping</strong>' item. There are two selection menus, and the default output method is different depending on how you select them.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1) group torrent by default - open group by default</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is the default state when no settings are touched.
                <br>
                While applying a group, all of them are opened and printed by default.
                <br>
                It may look a bit complicated, but you can see all the printed contents in detail at a glance.

                <br>
                <strong>2) group torrent by default - close group by default</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Apply a group to the list, but close it by default.
                <br>
                When you click the [+] part, it changes to [-] like the blue part in the picture and the group opens.
                <br>
                It has the advantage of being able to open and view only the necessary data.

                <br>
                <strong>3) Ungroup torrents by default - (regardless)</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Turn off the group to print. There is no way to open it on a list.
                <br>
                It can be said that it is most similar to P's style.

                No. 1 can see a lot of information, but it's a bit cluttered.
                <br>
                No. 3 looks familiar, but it is inconvenient to have to go inside to see the information properly.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the future, I plan to use setting 2, which is a style that combines the strengths of the two.
                <br>
                <br>
                Everyone has their own style, so choose the one you like and use it.

                Recently, sanctions were imposed on many users who accessed using the private relay service
                <br>
                There were a lot of people who used Apple devices without knowing the feature.
                <br>
                It has an IP bypass function and is thought to be a service similar to vpn and tor browser
                <br>
                <br>
                Basic Rule 8. If you look at the 9th paragraph
                <br>
                <br>
                <blockquote> In principle, access using virtual networks such as proxy, VPN, VPS, and cloud services is prohibited. If necessary, you must ask for permission from the management in advance, and when you ask for permission, you must prove that it is a service that is free from DMCA, does not record any logs, and is exclusively assigned an IP. For detailed tolerance criteria, please refer to the VPN tolerance section of the Help.</blockquote>
                <br>
                <br>
                <blockquote> Allow up to 2 IPs per account. If multiple accounts access from one IP, all accounts will be blocked.</blockquote>
                <br>
                <br>
                Access to the virtual network must be used with permission, and the private relay function does not meet the acceptance criteria
                <br>
                Since it is not an exclusive IP, all users are connected with the same IP
                <br>
                <br>
                Violation of the basic rules is a reason for blocking, but those who violated the rules for the first time went on to just a warning, and they will be blocked in case of a second violation
                <br>
                Please be careful not to connect to the virtual network without permission

            <div class="pad">T has a diverse group of people, some of which are healthy users who use them in a normal way, while others are bad users who try to exploit loopholes on the site. We set an appropriate line to prevent abuse by bad users while ensuring the convenience of healthy users for issues related to multiple IPs, multiple accounts, and passkeys.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1. Using the same account on multiple IPs at the same time</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                This is when you use the same account at the same time using computers in different places.
                <br>
                <br>
                * Advantage: Because many people use it at home and at work, it can be used regardless of where it is used.
                <br>
                * Disadvantages: There is a risk of multiple people sharing the account.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Currently, you can use up to one IP for each site access and torrent use.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>2. Simultaneous use of multiple accounts on one IP</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                When using multiple accounts in the same place.
                <br>
                <br>
                * Advantage: Multiple people can have their own accounts among family members or co-workers who share a single IP.
                <br>
                * Disadvantages: One person owns multiple accounts and risks using them in unusual ways.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The risk of duplicate accounts is too high and is currently banned.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>3. Using the same torrent at the same time using one account (passkey) from multiple IPs</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                * Advantage: You can use the same account to receive seeding data from the company at home.
                <br>
                * Disadvantages: When the passkey is leaked, there is a risk that unspecified people can use it without restrictions.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prohibited due to concerns about damage if the passkey is leaked.</span>

If necessary, you must seek permission from the management in advance, and when you ask for permission, you must prove that it is a DMCA-free, no-logged service, and IP-assigned service. For more detailed acceptance criteria, please refer to the VPN usage permission section of the Help.

                    Therefore, in this section, I will describe how to obtain permission from the management in which case.

                    - Regardless of paid or free service, you must obtain permission to use it.
                    <br>
                    - Example of the IP you want to access
                    - In case of using a ready-made service, information about the service provider / plan
                    <br>
                    - If you build your own, VPN construction method and hosting provider / plan information
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>VPN built in your own environment and used alone (regardless of web/seeding)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    In this case, despite the rules, you can use it without obtaining permission.

                    <br>
                    Ratio is the ratio of uploads to downloads.
                    <br>
                    That is, the upload capacity divided by the download capacity.
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                        <strong>Ratio = upload capacity Ã· download capacity</strong>
                    </blockquote>
                    <br>
                    For example, if you upload 15GB and download 6GB, the ratio will be 15/6 = 2.5.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since the ratio value is one of the most important criteria for determining the user's contribution to the tracker, T has a rule to maintain a ratio above a certain level, and if this is not met, the user will be punished.
                    <br>

                    Freeleech means to apply only uploads among torrent transmissions.
                    <br>
                    Downloading the material is called leeching, so it means downloading it for free.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike both upload and download when using general data, when using Freeleech data, only upload is checked and download is not checked. You can only take advantage of uploads like materials.&lt;br /&gt;
                    <br>
                    The purpose of running Freeleech material at T is to promote good material while also giving users who feel burdened with ratio access to the material. When it is difficult to maintain the ratio, receiving and seeding the Freeleech material will help with stable management.

                    Currently, free-rich settings can be made by the management team.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When it is judged that the data is reasonable by comprehensively considering the capacity, composition, usefulness, and sincerity of the registration, the management team grants free richness to the data.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The larger the size of the material, the more likely it is that pre-rich will be applied because users who download it will feel the burden on the ratio. However, the capacity is for reference only, not an absolute standard. If the quality of the material is poor or if the description is poorly written, no matter how large the data is, the free-rich may not be applied. In addition, even if the contents of the material are messy or the file name is arbitrary, it may be excluded from the freerich application.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If it is a particularly useful material or a material that is needed by several people, even a small amount can be pre-rich. Even if you write a description of the material with sincerity when registering the material, the possibility of free-rich will increase that much.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The staff may not be able to go through all the materials, so valuable materials may be overlooked. If you feel that the material you registered is worthy of Freeleech application, please register and ask the staff to set up Freeleech. Freeleech will apply if appropriate.

                    <br>
                    * Number of cedars for each torrent
                    <br>
                    * Capacity of individual torrents
                    <br>
                    * Whether individual torrents are exclusive
                    <br>
                    * Time elapsed since upload of individual torrent
                    <br>
                    * Rich types such as pre/half/double bleaching of individual torrents

                    To download data using torrent, you need to install a client that supports the bittorrent protocol. There are many different types of clients with different personalities, so you can use the one that's right for you. Among them, the most commonly used is 'qBittorrent', which can be used satisfactorily by everyone from beginners to advanced users.

                    <br>
                    The explanation is in qBittorrent.

                    If you click [Receive], you can receive a Torrent Seed file (*.torrent) containing information about the material. Transmission using torrent is done through this file. In Korean, it is often expressed as a seed file. The [Receive] menu can be used in both the list of materials and the information screen.

                    <br>
                    Click [Open] to start downloading by adding the torrent to the client immediately, or select [Save] to save the file and add it separately. To add them separately, you can use the 'Add Torrent' menu or use drag and drop.

                    (In rare cases, if your ISP blocks files with a torrent extension from being transmitted, you can check the 'Download torrent in text file format' item in your account's profile settings to receive a file with a txt extension and use it instead. )

                        Because torrent is a P2P method of exchanging data between users, unlike Webhard, someone needs to give it to someone to receive it. Even if you start, if no one who uses the same torrent has material to give to you, the transfer may not take place. In that case, you have to wait for the person with the data to access it.

                        From now on, the position of receiving becomes the position of giving. It is not the end of receiving torrents, but the basic principle is to give back to others as much as you have received. It is recommended to continue seeding if the circumstances allow, rather than stopping immediately after the download is complete. You need to upload through seeding to maintain the ratio, so please seed enough for yourself.

                        Among the material on this tracker are individual torrents set to free-rich, half-rich and double upload. Freerich is a torrent that does not apply a download number, half-rich is a torrent that has a download number that is half the size of the torrent, and double upload is a torrent that doubles the uploaded capacity when seeding. In order to properly manage your own ratio, make good use of individual torrents set to free-rich, half-rich, and double-upload.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After downloading individual torrents set to freerich or halfrich, there may be cases where the download figures are not properly reflected. In this case, be sure to request confirmation from the management message or the help channel while seeding is in progress. If you file an objection without seeding after downloading, there is no way to check, so it is not possible to restore the downloaded number that was not applied properly.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Please be very careful as incorrect torrent data may affect the ratio. This most often happens when you download torrents or anything that has been uploaded with material that violates the rules, or contains errors in the file itself. However, even if you lose your download figures due to these materials, this tracker will not recover or compensate you. This is due to the responsibility of the uploader for not familiarizing themselves with the uploading rules and the responsibility of the richer for not understanding the state of the material. However, if it is recognized as an internal system problem, such as a global free rich or an error in the download number of a donor (sponsor), it may be restored or replaced with an equivalent condition after confirmation.

                        Among the materials in a particular category are pack materials that combine several individual torrents into one torrent. Pack materials refer to materials that are uploaded over several rounds. Due to this pack data upload, previously uploaded individual data may be deleted in bulk. As a result, the previous individual data will not be applied to this tracker even after seeding. Always check your seeding list.

            </div>
            <div class="pad">
                Recently, sanctions were imposed on many users who accessed using the private relay service
                <br>
                There were a lot of people who used Apple devices without knowing the feature.
                <br>
                It has an IP bypass function and is thought to be a service similar to vpn and tor browser
                <br>
                <br>
                Basic Rule 8. If you look at the 9th paragraph
                <br>
                <br>
                <blockquote> In principle, access using virtual networks such as proxy, VPN, VPS, and cloud services is prohibited. If necessary, you must ask for permission from the management in advance, and when you ask for permission, you must prove that it is a service that is free from DMCA, does not record any logs, and is exclusively assigned an IP. For detailed tolerance criteria, please refer to the VPN tolerance section of the Help.</blockquote>
                <br>
                <br>
                <blockquote> Allow up to 2 IPs per account. If multiple accounts access from one IP, all accounts will be blocked.</blockquote>
                <br>
                <br>
                Access to the virtual network must be used with permission, and the private relay function does not meet the acceptance criteria
                <br>
                Since it is not an exclusive IP, all users are connected with the same IP
                <br>
                <br>
                Violation of the basic rules is a reason for blocking, but those who violated the rules for the first time went on to just a warning, and they will be blocked in case of a second violation
                <br>
                Please be careful not to connect to the virtual network without permission

                <br>
                The notification function is a function that sends a list of newly uploaded torrents in RSS format to users at regular intervals.
                <br>
                It is mainly used by comprehensive trackers to automatically download TV programs you watch.
                <br>
                It is used on the music tracker to keep track of new albums by your favorite musicians.
                <br>
                Or, it can be used to build up a buffer for frenzy. (by setting notifications for both popular entertainment shows and dramas)
                <br>
                However, there are some downsides to using it to build buffers.
                <br>
                If the notification volume is excessive, the hard drive will shed tears of blood...
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, I am going to explain how to use the notification function using the popular sitcom High Kick Through the Roof as an example.
                <br>
                It is possible to receive multiple programs at the same time as one filter, but I will explain it by notifying only one.
                <br>
                And I'll just skip the unnecessary stuff without explanation.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="color:blue">1. First, go to the main page of <strong>High kick through the roof</strong> and <strong>copy</strong> the title.</span>
                <br>
                This is because even if there is only one wrong space, there is no notification. ex) High kick through the roof

                                        Here's how the downloader's <strong>filter</strong> and <strong>Exception</strong> work.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Stage 1. RSS Receive (Full List)
                                        <br>
                                        Step 2. Only torrents that satisfy the filter condition are filtered out of the entire list
                                        <br>
                                        Step 3. Excluding those that are subject to exception conditions
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        You can use wildcards (?,*) in filters and exceptions.
                                        <br>
                                        The condition is "|" separated by

                If you have a good resource, upload a torrent and share it with other users. Uploading is not as difficult as you might think and it is a simple process that you get used to after doing it a few times. However, <strong>do not upload in a hurry without understanding the site characteristics and upload rules properly.</strong> If you violate the rules, you may suffer disadvantages such as deletion of data, warnings, and demoting to beginners. Please.
                <br>
                <br>
                Be sure to read the upload rules at least once and refer to them regularly if you have any doubts.

                A client that supports the BitTorrent protocol is required to upload.
                <br>
                If you do not have a separate client, qBittorrent, which is the most commonly used, is recommended.

It is an important process to improve the quality of the registered data, so please write carefully and accurately. <strong>Most of the upload rules are about writing this content.</strong>
                    <br>

If you change the classification while writing, the contents of the writing will be lost, so you must specify the classification first. Depending on the classification and the characteristics of the material, there is a big difference between the rest of the preparation methods. Write each item according to the upload rules by classification. It is safe to copy and save large amounts of content as there is a risk that the content you wrote may be lost due to an error during the upload process.
                        <br>
                        Since it is difficult to deal with all the preparation methods here, detailed explanations are omitted. For practical and detailed writing methods, please refer to the registration form of similar materials already uploaded by other users and the following guide.

                                    After confirming that the registration has been successfully completed on the site, from now on, it is necessary to check the status of the client for seeding. Seeding means that the person who has all the data waits for others to receive it or uploads (transmits) it. Immediately after uploading, the only person with the data is you, so you must seed it.

                                    For manual update, you can use <strong>Update Tracker</strong> in the torrent menu. If this menu is not available because it is inactive, you can <strong>stop and restart the torrent</strong> to have the same effect. . Depending on the version of the client, the behavior is slightly different, so use the method that works and works for you.

                                    After registering torrent, it may take some time for the information to be reflected in the tracker. It is recommended to allow at least 10 seconds between the registration of the site and the start of the torrent. If the update does not work all at once, wait for a while and try again in the same way. If it doesn't work after long retrying <a href="#c7">

                                    As shown above, if the <strong>green</strong> icon appears and the status of the tracker tab is <strong>operation</strong>, seeding is normal. If you keep it this way, other users can receive the data when they need it. Torrent transmission starts only when other users receive it, so just because there is no transmission after uploading does not mean there is something wrong. If someone is interested in the uploaded material and starts downloading it, then the transmission will start. If the other side does not seed from this side, you cannot receive it, so the longer the seeding time is, the better.

                                    Just as trackers send information to clients, clients send information to trackers. If the error that the seeding information is not properly communicated persists, the tracker may treat it as an inactive torrent even though it actually has a seed, as if it does not have a seed, and other users may mistake it for a non-seeding torrent. If the torrent operation is normal, you should check whether the seeding information is properly reflected in the tracker.

                                    Each page that displays the torrent list (torrent menu, torrent groups, my upload torrent, etc.) has a part where peer (seed & richer) information is displayed. Even if the client performs seeding normally, it is natural for the seed number to appear as <span style="color:red">0</span> immediately after <strong>registration.</strong> Peer information is reflected after torrent registration This is because it takes up to 5 minutes to complete. Please note that there is a slight time lag before peer information is reflected on each page. If the torrent registration and seeding status are normal, it will be displayed as <strong>1</strong> within a few minutes of starting seeding.

                                    Since the content written in the upload form only applies to the information of the torrent group (titles for various media, TV episodes, etc.), it is necessary to separately add information about the artist (person, TV program title, production company, etc.). The fix is ââintuitive, so it's not difficult. If the artist's information corresponding to the torrent you uploaded is blank, please fill it out nicely. The effort of one person helps many people. Even better if you pay attention to what you haven't uploaded. However, filling in artist information is not compulsory, so there is no need to feel burdened.

                        While uploading, you may receive a request for correction of the uploaded material. Since it is mainly a request for correction of problems, it is easy to feel embarrassed when a message about a correction request is received. However, the correction request is not made to criticize the mistake, but to inform the uploader of what he did not know and to give him a chance to fix it. If you do not follow even the basic rules, you will be sanctioned if you upload it in a dry or habitual manner.
                        <strong>If you receive a modification request message, please show that you actively respond and handle it.</strong> If communication is necessary, the uploader may request correction of his/her own material or use the correction request bulletin board.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the basic explanation, I made it by checking <strong>Start distribution</strong> when creating a torrent. In this case, the torrent is added to the client at the same time the seed is created, so there is no need to download the seed from the tracker and add it again. In order to reduce the hassle of deliberately re-downloading seeds and to avoid mistakes that are easy to make when positioning materials while adding new ones, it is recommended to check them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, for users who are already familiar with the upload methods of other trackers, the recommended method may feel awkward and it may be easier to create seeds without checking <strong>start distribution</strong>. What works best for you. <strong>If you're comfortable with re-downloading from the tracker, create a seed without checking Start Distribution.</strong> You can.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In this way, the torrent is not added to the client immediately, so after uploading the torrent to the site, you need to separately <strong>seed and add</strong> to the client. In this case, <strong>the location of the data must be directly specified</strong>. Be careful as it is easy to make the mistake of omitting or mislocating this process. If you check <strong>Skip hash check</strong>, you can skip the check process.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Although divided in two ways, there is a more diverse branch in detail. When creating a seed, you can add it directly to the client by checking the start distribution without entering the announcement URL, and <strong>add tracker</strong> while receiving the seed from the tracker and adding it. Normally 'add tracker' on private trackers is something to be wary of, but this time it's a torrent from the same tracker, so it's okay to add a tracker.
                        <br>
                        If you create a seed without checking <strong>private torrent</strong>, you must download it again and add it. Seeds that have not been checked private can be registered on the site, but seeds downloaded after registration are automatically checked for privacy. In this case, the hash value of the original seed and the downloaded seed will be different, so be very careful as they are not compatible with each other. It is convenient to think of it as an unconditional check.
                        <br>
                        There are many other factors, but many of them are learned on their own. First, stick to the basics, and then develop an application method that suits you.

                                    However, if it is only your own torrent, <strong>this is because the hash value is not changed when re-uploading after deleting the torrent.</strong> When re-uploading after deleting the torrent, if you re-upload the previously uploaded seed as it is, the seeding information is not reflected properly . When uploading again, you need to create a seed with a different hash value and raise it.

                                    First, find out the fragment size of the torrent uploaded by the client first. When creating a new seed, the size of the piece is different from the seed that was placed earlier. When the creation is finished, the torrent uploaded with the existing seeds is deleted and replaced with the newly created seeds. This method of making different hash values ââis also useful when seeding or uploading the same material on multiple trackers

                Nouns, verbs (including be, been, am, are, is, was, and were), adverbs, dependent conjunctions (including when as and if are not used as prepositions), adjectives (including when so is used as an adjective), pronouns (including he, she, we, it) capitalizes the first letter.
                <br>
                e.g.) I <strong>Am</strong> the Night, Where <strong>Death</strong>
                <strong>Is</strong>
                <strong>Most</strong> Alive, World <strong>So</strong> Cold, This Is <strong>As</strong> Good <strong>As</strong> It Gets
                <br>
                <br>
                1.3. Long prepositions
                <br>
                Prepositions of four or more letters, such as into, with, upon, capitalize the first letter.
                <br>
                e.g.) Thorn <strong>Without</strong> a Rose, Jump <strong>Into</strong> Fire, Wrath <strong>Upon</strong> Ourselves
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>2.</strong> Always enter lowercase letters
                <br>
                2.1. article
                <br>
                The articles (a, an, the) are written in lower case, unless they are included in the singer's name.
                <br>
                e.g.) Sign from <strong>the</strong> Northside, Just <strong>a</strong> Little, The Best of <strong>The</strong> Temptations
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                But can be used as a conjunction, preposition, or adverb. It is mostly used as a conjunction or preposition, and in this case it can be written in lowercase, but in very special cases it is used as an adverb. When used as an adverb, it makes sense even if it is replaced with another adverb such as only or just.
                <br>
                e.g.) You Were <strong>But</strong> a Ghost in My Arms, Life Is <strong>But</strong> a Dream
                <br>
                However, when but is replaced with except to make sense, or when it is used to contrast the preceding and following phrases of a sentence, it is not an adverb, so write it in lowercase.
                <br>
                e.g.) I Know You Are <strong>but</strong> What Am I, I Don't Know What It Is <strong>but</strong> I Like It

                <br>
                2.3.1. Versus
                <br>
                Versus and its abbreviations vs., v. is a preposition of 4 or more letters, but is usually written in lowercase.
                <br>
                e.g.) Spy <strong>vs.</strong> Spy, Birds <strong>v.</strong> Worms
                <br>
                2.3.2. Et cetera
                <br>
                When Et cetera or its abbreviation etc. is used in the meaning of and so on, and so forth, it is also written in lower case.
                <br>
                e.g.) Time After Time <strong>etc.</strong>
                <br>
                2.3.3. From

                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>3.</strong> How to write symbols

                <br>
                A place that can be easily recalled is right here,

                This is the search term field in the search form.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                But there is another one.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you look at the top of the site menu, there are six input fields.

                <br>
                A detailed explanation of each input will be given later, but the thing to pay attention to here is Torrents or Artists.
                <br>
                <br>
                Enter a search term here and press Enter to search for the relevant item.
                <br>
                This is a very useful search bar that you can put directly anywhere on the site and do a one-shot search.

                <br>
                I received a 1080p video of a movie called 'Hangman' from somewhere yesterday and enjoyed watching it.
                <br>
                I'm thinking of uploading this for other users of T to see.
                <br>
                <br>
                First of all, it goes into duplicate check.

                <br>
                In the search bar, type 'Hangman' in the Torrents input field and press Enter!
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                Oh man, the hangman is already up.
                <img border="0" src="static/common/smileys/sad.gif" alt=""> But when I look closely, only 720p is uploaded.
                <br>
                What I have is 1080p, it's okay to upload this.
                <img border="0" src="static/common/smileys/smile.gif" alt="">
                <br>
                Now, the duplicate check is over and the same movie is uploaded, but it is in a different format than what I have, so I can upload it.
                <br>
                How do I proceed now?
                <br>
                <br>
                If the answer is 'enter the upload menu', I would
                <img border="0" src="static/common/smileys/no.gif" alt="">
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                If nothing is found at all, of course you have to start uploading using the upload menu.
                <br>
                However, for now, the same content has already been uploaded.
                <br>
                There is a good menu that can be used in this case.
                <br>
                <br>
                Don't go to the 'Upload' menu, but click on the title of the movie to enter.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <center>
                    <a href="https://myimg.me/images/2019/11/11/7daae5de229bd1b262da2811436420b2.png" data-rel="prettyPhoto">

                <br>
                <br>
                If you go to the movie page and look at the menu at the top, there is <span style="color:red">
                    <strong>add format</strong>
                </span>.
                <br>
                <br>
                In a situation where another format of the same movie has already been uploaded, this 'Add Format' menu should be used to make uploading easier, avoid mistakes, and avoid overwriting, which I will tell you later.
                <br>
                <br>
                Press the menu to enter.

                The upload form will pop up, but there will be subtle differences compared to when you enter the upload menu.
                <br>
                Part of the field is already filled with something.
                <br>
                <br>
                Classification, director, movie title, year of production, and the movie introduction along with the poster image section below are included in advance.
                <br>
                If you look at these items, they are common to the same movie.
                <br>
                It's a lot easier than going into the upload menu and writing everything from scratch, including the common ones.
                <br>
                No need to worry about accidentally misspelling the director or title, and no annoying rewriting of the movie introduction.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are important points besides that it is less cumbersome and avoids mistakes by not entering the common items separately.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this case, it is about the part that corresponds to the 'introduction to the movie'. It's the red square.
                <br>
                If you write something new in this part while uploading material in a different format from the same movie, the content previously written by someone else will be overwritten. It would be nice if it was written better, but someone who likes to write moderately simple can overwrite it. Then, the person who wrote it with great care before that time will be pushed out and will not be displayed. It is possible to revive it by using the history function, but if there is already good content, overwriting it again has many disadvantages.
                <br>
                Of course, if the existing content is insufficient, you can add more. By default, you can add flesh to the old content loaded.
                <br>
                You should always be careful with this area. (The image input box has the same character, but I omitted that story)
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This area is the same for all inputs at the same location in other categories. This time, because it was a movie, it became 'Introduction to the Movie', and if it was a TV program, the information input field for the episode, if it was music, the album description, and other categories have the same characteristics, only the name is different.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now all that's left is to fill out the rest with these pre-written ones and register them.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, let's review it one more time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1) Make sure to double check before uploading.
                    <br>
                    2) Use the 'add format' function when uploading additional material with a different format to the same content.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Even if you always remember two things, you're half way through the upload.
                <br>
                <br>
                Please actively utilize the format add-on function.
                <br>
                <br>
                * I'm running out of time, so I'm posting it in a hasty form.

If necessary, you must ask for permission from the management in advance, and when you ask for permission, you must prove that it is a service that is free from DMCA, does not record any logs, and is exclusively assigned an IP. For detailed tolerance criteria, please refer to the VPN tolerance section of the Help.</blockquote>

                <br>
                Access to the virtual network must be used with permission, and the private relay function does not meet the acceptance criteria
                <br>
                Since it is not an exclusive IP, all users are connected with the same IP
                <br>
                <br>
                Violation of the basic rules is a reason for blocking, but those who violated the rules for the first time went on to just a warning, and they will be blocked in case of a second violation
                <br>
                Please be careful not to connect to the virtual network without permission

            <div class="pad">Modification request (report) is not a feature introduced to give warnings. However, there are many unfortunate cases, such as receiving a warning as a result of seeing the handling of correction requests for a long period of time. Therefore, through this article, we would like to help users better cope with the request for correction in the future.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                        <strong>Purpose of the request</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                - Giving users the opportunity to recognize their mistakes and correct them
                <br>
                - Prevention of indiscriminate deletion of data due to violation of upload rules
                <br>
                - Prevention of indiscriminate warnings due to unfamiliarity with upload rules

                <br>
                - Modification request message notification appeared, but ignored
                <br>
                - A modification request message notification appeared, but was repeatedly ignored (immediately leading to a warning)
                <br>
                - In the case of recognizing the request for correction, but responding to it by posting a forum post or a message from the management, etc.
                - I received a request for correction, but I think I'm talking about something I don't know well, ignore it
                <br>
                - I received a request for correction, but I did not know how to deal with it, so I ignored it
                <br>
                - I received a request for correction, but I simply postponed the responsibility to the management and avoided it
                <br>
                - Started arguing with the management who raised the request for correction
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                </ul>
                <br>
                1. Check the contents of the request for correction and, if necessary, correct it.
                <br>
                2. Resubmit all relevant information, such as responding to all requests for correction, incorrect content of the request for correction, or incomprehension.
                <br>
                3. Receive an answer in any form and repeat steps 1 and 2 above.

                - "I got a message asking me to fix it, but I've looked through the rules and upload page to see what's wrong, but I'm not sure." : Even in this case, do not neglect the request for correction and ask for help even if you have made sufficient efforts.
                <br>
                - "I received a message to edit, but I don't see a page where I can edit." : If you have difficulties with a function or believe you do not have the right to edit, please pinpoint the wrong part and resubmit a correction request for help. Certain permissions are required for torrent titles, but in most cases, you can edit them by clicking the "Edit group information" page or the "Edit" button for individual torrents you uploaded.
