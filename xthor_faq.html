    <b>What does p2p mean? What is the BitTorrent protocol?</b><a name="general1" id="general1"></a><br>
    <br>
    <em><strong>BitTorrent</strong></em> is a peer-to-peer (P2P) data transfer protocol across a computer network.
The BitTorrent protocol starts from the following observation:<br>When information is on a single computer server, the <em>more</em> it is requested, the <em>less</em> it is accessible (by saturation of the server).<br>This trend is reversed if each computer client having downloaded the information immediately becomes <em>server</em> in turn.
One way to do this is to cut the information to be shared into segments, and distribute different segments to different interlocutors so that they themselves have something to exchange.<br>
  <br>
    <b>How do I contact a staff member?</b><a name="general2" id="general2"></a><br>

    <div id="answer_2_text"><b>What is a torrent?</b><a name="notionbase1" id="notionbase1"></a><br>
    <br>
    A Torrent is a <em>metadata</em> file containing the Internet address of the Torrent Tracker. It also contains information such as the size of the files, their number. <br> It also contains the 'checksum' (Hash) which verifies the integrity of the file.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What is a torrent client?</b><a name="notionbase2" id="notionbase2"></a><br>
    <br>
    A Torrent client is software that allows you to use the Torrent protocol, so to play files whose extension is <em>.torrent</em>.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What is the tracker for?</b><a name="notionbase3" id="notionbase3"></a><br>
    <br>
    A tracker is a server that always knows which seeds and which peers are in the sources. Clients regularly send him information. In exchange, they receive information about other clients to which they can connect. The tracker is not directly involved in the data transfer and does not own a copy of the file.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What does Upload/Download (UL/DL) mean?</b><a name="notionbase4" id="notionbase4"></a><br>
    <br>
    Upload is how much data you have sent (transmit) and download is how much data you have downloaded.<br> To save some time, it is common to shorten the term 'Upload' in 'UL' and the term 'Download' in 'DL'.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What does Leechers/Seeders mean?</b><a name="notionbase5" id="notionbase5"></a><br>
    <br>
    A leecher is a client wishing to download the file, but not owning it in full. This term also has a pejorative meaning to qualify those who download without sending a counterpart on the network.<br> On the other hand, seeders are those who share complete files. To be able to download an entire release, a minimum of 1 seeder is required.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What is the ratio?</b><a name="notionbase6" id="notionbase6"></a><br>
    <br>
    The ratio is the ratio between the data sent, shared (the upload) and the number of data received (the download).<br>
  It is important to distinguish between your overall ratio on your account and your individual ratio for each torrent by
  seed or leech. The overall ratio takes into account the total uploaded and the total downloaded to your account from your
  arrival on site. The individual ratio takes into account these same values ​​but for each torrent.<br>
    <br>
    You can see two other forms of your ratio instead of a number: <br><br> - 'Inf.', which is just an abbreviation of Infinite, this
  means you uploaded 0 bytes and uploaded a non-zero value (ul/dl becomes infinite)<br>
   - '---', which should be read as 'unavailable', and only appears when you have downloaded and uploaded 0 bytes
  (ul/dl = 0/0, division by zero being impossible).<br></div>

    <b>I can't connect to the site. Why?</b><a name="members3" id="members3"></a><br>
    <br>
    If you are unable to connect to the site, start by emptying your browser's cookies, as well as the cache (Ctrl + F5 on Firefox for example).<br> You may also have sent to one too many erroneous data from our servers, you are therefore blacklisted from our servers for a period of 30 minutes.<br> Your computer is infected by a virus or by a trojan, the purpose of which is to attack the sites on which you surf. In this case, clean your PC using anti-virus software or tools such as MalwareBytes.<br>In rare cases, our servers may be under maintenance, and the site will therefore be inaccessible for a few minutes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>I can no longer find my identifiers, what should I do?</b><a name="members4" id="members4"></a><br>
    <br>
    If you have lost your login credentials (login and/or password), use the 'Recover password' link on the login page. Enter the email address registered on the site. You will then receive an email containing your login details (new password). <br><br>If you get an error when entering your email address in the dialog box to recover your identifiers, it is probably that you are entering an email address that is different from the one registered on the site. Remember to update your email address on the site when it changes. Also remember to check your spam box, if you do not receive the email containing your identifiers from us. <br><br>You also have the option of resetting your password if you have defined your secret question/answer in your account. To do this, click on the 'Reset Password' link on the login page, fill in the email address associated with your account and answer your secret question. You can then choose a new password. <br><br>As a last resort, contact the staff.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What is the passkey?</b><a name="members5" id="members5"></a><br>
    <br>
    Each member has a personal passkey: a key randomly generated by the system. It identifies you to the tracker when you download or upload.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Invitations</b><a name="members6" id="members6"></a><br>
    <br>
    As a 'guest' you are responsible for your guests. Sanctions taken against an invited member will also be passed on to the member who invited him.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Are multiple accounts allowed?</b><a name="members7" id="members7"></a><br>
    <br>
    You should not create multiple accounts for the same person. The result is the deletion of ALL accounts for that person.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Tips for raising your ratio.</b><a name="members8" id="members8"></a><br>
    <br>
    In order to raise your ratio quickly, several possibilities are available to you:<p></p>
<p>- Take torrents in Freeleech (even if they don't interest you), which have just been uploaded and which have leechers on them. Download stats will not be counted. Only what you send will count. So your ratio will increase.</p>
<p>- Make a donation to recover an upload amount.</p>
<p>- Put back torrents that you still have on your hard drive as seed. If one or more leechers take them, you can send them data without having had an additional download deducted.<br></p></div>

    <b>How do I download a file?</b><a name="dl1" id="dl1"></a><br>
    <br>
    On each torrent description page, you have a gray button at the top with a green arrow and marked 'Download' which allows you, by clicking on it, to download the .torrent to add to your client.<br>
    <br>
    <b>How do I reseed a torrent?</b><a name="dl2" id="dl2"></a><br>
    <br>
    To do this, you must re-upload the .torrent file again from our site. When you open this .torrent file, your client asks you where you want to save this file.<br> You just need to indicate, on your hard drive, the location of the file/folder.<br>Your client will re -verify the data and seed again on it.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Why a torrent can disappear from the site?</b><a name="dl3" id="dl3"></a><br>
    <br>
    The torrent has been deleted by a staff member or its uploader. It could be a duplicate of another torrent or may not follow site rules.<br>This torrent might also be dead. It had no more seeders and therefore could no longer be downloaded by other members.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Why are my downloads stuck at 99%?</b><a name="dl4" id="dl4"></a><br>
    <br>
    For large releases, many parts are required. Thus, having reached around 99%, the parts come together to form your final file. This can take a long time, but be patient, you will eventually get the last missing pieces back.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Why is my download speed slow?</b><a name="dl5" id="dl5"></a><br>
    <br>
    Your download speed depends mainly on the number of seeders, and the quality of their connections.<br> If a torrent is very recent, it is necessary to be patient if the number of seeders is low, and the number of leecher high .<br>
    <br>
    <b>Why did I upload more than the file size?</b><a name="dl6" id="dl6"></a><br>
    <br>
    If your client received bad data, he had to re-upload it. So that's why you uploaded more data than the file size. To avoid this you have in your client a tick option: This is often an advanced option/preference to 'kick/ban' clients sending you wrong data.<br><br>This is also possible if your torrent client is that of the Freebox Revolution. There are currently no solutions.<br>

    <br>
    The Hit &amp; Run is totally prohibited on the site.<br>
  You must remain in seed for a minimum of 24 hours on each downloaded torrent for Users and Enthusiasts and 6 hours for VIPs and Celebrities. <br>
  If the seed time is not respected, then you must have obtained a minimum ratio of 0.8 on the torrent.<br>
  If neither of these two goals are met after 10 days after downloading the torrent, you will be notified for Hit &amp; Run. <br>
  After 15 H&amp;R, your account will be deactivated.<br><br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Prevent Hits &amp; Run? :</span> <br>
  From your profile, you can see your download history via the 'Completed' tab, and see the seed time of each torrent. <br>
  If one of your torrents has a seed time lower than what is required, re-seed it as soon as possible in order to reach the necessary seed time before the 10 days from the date of download of this torrent is over. sold out.<br><br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to remove Hits &amp; Run? :</span><br>
   The staff never deletes from H&amp;R unless the relevant torrent has been deleted, it is your responsibility to fix your errors, so several possibilities are available to remedy this.<br>
- You can put the concerned torrent back in seed. Once the required seeding time has been reached, the H&amp;R will be automatically removed from your account. (You can re-download the torrent if you no longer own it, this will indeed erase your H&amp;R for that torrent)<br>
- You can redeem an H&amp;R with your $ via the $ page <a href="https://xthor.tk/shop.php">HERE</a>. <br>
- You can make a donation, regardless of the amount, this will erase all your H&amp;R and reactivate your download right if it has been revoked by the system<br></div>
