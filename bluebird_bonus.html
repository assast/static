<b>Principles of earning coins (Only for 100% comleted torrents):</b>
<br>
For every hour of seeding the user receives <b>X coins: </b>
<br>
<br>
X = index of age + size index + seeds index</font>
<hr>
Index of age = 0.03*k, where k is age of release in months

<br><br>Size index = 0.1 – up to 10 gb and 0.2 – from 10 gb

<br><br>Seeds index = 0.1 - lots of seeders (3 and more) &amp 0.2 - less then 3 seeders (1 or 2)

<br><hr>All coins stats is counted for the torrents older than 7 days. The amount of torrents being seeded is not limited.
<br><hr><p>
Notice!!! Only users, who's ratio is lower than 5.0 may exchange their coins for upload. The rest of users are welcome to accumulate ‘Seed bonus reserve’ and use it if necessary in case of fallen ratio and for invites purchase.
